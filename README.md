# Spamsms-Identifier
SpamSMS-Identifier is an intelligent system developed to automatically differentiate between spam and legitimate text messages received on mobile devices. 
    Programming Language:
        Python: Python is a popular language for machine learning and natural language processing tasks due to its extensive libraries and ease of use.

    Libraries and Frameworks:
        Scikit-Learn: A machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes various algorithms for classification and text processing.
        NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or SpaCy: Python libraries for natural language processing tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.
        TensorFlow or PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks that can be used for building and training neural network models, especially useful for complex language understanding tasks.
        Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It can be used for handling and processing the dataset.
        Flask or FastAPI: Lightweight Python web frameworks suitable for building APIs. They can be used to create a web service for real-time SMS classification.
        NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python. It is often used for handling numerical operations and data structures.
        Matplotlib or Seaborn: Libraries for creating visualizations and graphs to analyze the performance of the model.

    Text Representation and Vectorization:
        TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It's commonly used for text vectorization.
        Word Embeddings: Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings can be used to convert words into dense vector representations, capturing semantic meanings.

    Machine Learning Algorithms:
        Naive Bayes: A simple probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It's often used for text classification tasks.
        Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised machine learning algorithm that can classify text into different categories.
        Deep Learning Models: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) can be employed for capturing sequential patterns in text data.

    Database (Optional for Storing Data):
        SQLite or PostgreSQL: Lightweight and easy-to-set-up databases that can be used if there's a need to store and manage the SMS data.

    Version Control and Collaboration:
        Git and GitHub: Version control system for tracking changes in the codebase and GitHub for collaborative development, sharing, and project management.
